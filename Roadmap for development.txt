Roadmap for development:

Animate individual pictographs and sequences
Make a web app so people can access and share sequences easily
Finish implementing rotation direction buttons
Rebuild sequence construction interface as a guided, clickable flow
Add ability to systematically modify turns in a sequence
Develop a system to track turn patterns (right/left, numbers) to apply to sequences
Automatically complete a sequence after constructing the first line
Create a finite list of permutation options to apply (rotational, mirrored, swapped)
Analyze videos of spinners to detect positions and motions, reconstruct sequences
Complete rotation button implementation
Rebuild sequence constructor interface
Build kinetic encyclopedia/dictionary for browsing sequences
Create automatic sequence completion
Build system for tracking/applying turn patterns


Users should be able to use the number pin pad on the right of their keyboard to choose what 
location the hands go to and construct a sequence this way.
