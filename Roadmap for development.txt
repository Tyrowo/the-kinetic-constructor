Roadmap for development:

Animate individual pictographs and sequences
Make a web app so people can access and share sequences easily
Finish implementing rotation direction buttons
Automatically complete a sequence after constructing the first line
Create a finite list of permutation options to apply (rotational, mirrored, swapped)
Analyze videos of spinners to detect positions and motions, reconstruct sequences
Complete rotation button implementation
Rebuild sequence constructor interface

Users should be able to use the number pin pad on the right of their keyboard to choose what 
location the hands go to and construct a sequence this way.


Add curved triads to the list of props
