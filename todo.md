- The settings panel needs to drop down with various options, rather than open up a dialog every time.

- We need to incorporate a widget underneath the sequence widget, which is specifically for modifying the turns for the pictographs within the sequence widget.

- We need to adjust the start position picker to allow the user to select the orientations of their starting pictograph.

- When the user changes the prop type, it currently iterates over every single cached pictograph. It would be great if it just modified the visible pictographs so that it's not so computationally expensive. Then we need to implement a way for the pictographs which are displayed to set their prop type to the correct prop type when they are made visible.

- Add a setting to remove the colored border in the settings.

- Make it so the colored border has its thickness determined by the size of the pictograph. When the pictographs are very small, this colored border currently looks too thick.

- Add right click options to each pictograph that allow you to do various things such as add turns.

- Allow the user to select a specific pictograph in the sequence and modify and modify its turns. Maybe there can be buttons that pop up on the bottom part of the pictograph to indicate that you're currently modifying that one. also indicate to the user when their mouse is over a picked a graph that they can click on it.

- Integrate a miniature graph that represents the dimensions of the current graph in play which allows the user to select entire rows or entire columns and modify their turns.

- Allow the user to easily select the length of their sequence

- Introduce a tracking mechanism which checks if the end position of a sequence matches its start positions.

- Add more VTG terminology. Add mode in bottom right corner - SO,SS,TO,TS,QTS,QTO. Allow the user to toggle both vtg and kinetic alphabet letters On or off. That's a really good idea.
