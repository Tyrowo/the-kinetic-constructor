We're trying to target what the differences are between the opening and closing variations of Lambda and how we can spot them.

it's determined by the rotation direction of each motion under different contexts. I'll outline the ones I see before . 


If the direction is closing:

if dash is west to east
    if static is at north
        static prop_rot_dir = CLOCKWISE
    elif static is at south
        static prop_rot_dir = COUNTER_CLOCKWISE
elif dash is east to west
    if static is at north
        static prop_rot_dir = COUNTER_CLOCKWISE
    elif static is at south
        static prop_rot_dir = CLOCKWISE
elif dash is north to south
    if static is at west
        static prop_rot_dir = COUNTER_CLOCKWISE
    elif static is at east
        static prop_rot_dir = CLOCKWISE
elif dash is south to north
    if static is at west
        static prop_rot_dir = CLOCKWISE
    elif static is at east
        static prop_rot_dir = COUNTER_CLOCKWISE

if the direction is opening:

if dash is west to east
    if static is at north
        static prop_rot_dir = COUNTER_CLOCKWISE
    elif static is at south
        static prop_rot_dir = CLOCKWISE
elif dash is east to west
    if static is at north
        static prop_rot_dir = CLOCKWISE
    elif static is at south
        static prop_rot_dir = COUNTER_CLOCKWISE
elif dash is north to south
    if static is at west
        static prop_rot_dir = CLOCKWISE
    elif static is at east
        static prop_rot_dir = COUNTER_CLOCKWISE
elif dash is south to north
    if static is at west
        static prop_rot_dir = COUNTER_CLOCKWISE
    elif static is at east
        static prop_rot_dir = CLOCKWISE


Our new tuples will look like Λ(s,2,1,op,cl)
The op,cl at the end are special and will only appear with Λ.
The first number (2) will correspond with the first of this pair (op) and the second number (1) will correspond with the second of this pair (cl).
When in Λ, one of our motions is a dash and the other is static. So the first number will correspond with the dash and the second number will correspond with the static.
In Λ-, which is a Type5, both motions are dashes, so the first number will correspond with the blue dash and the second number will correspond with the red dash. This is the default behaviour when motion types are the same. 
I'm going to need help getting the buttons set up, and also training the program to recognize what the current tuple will be based on the motions that are currently in the pictograph.
