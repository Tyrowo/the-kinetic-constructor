- Video 2 - Notation Systems:
  - An explanation of the existence of previous notation systems.
    - VTG
    - 9-Square Theory
    - Siteswap
    - A succinct explanation of the differences between vtg and the kinetic alphabet.
      - Radial vs absolute
      - The Kinetic Alphabet puts together combinations of simultaneous motions, assigning each a letter variable, similar to how siteswap assigns each throw a number. 
      - Vtg uses the four modes plus the hand:prop number system to classify continuous pathways and combine them.
      - TKA's primary purpose is to construct sequences which are non-continuous and can travel to/from any of 9 distinct locations. 

- Video 2 - Types:
    - Introduce the grid.
    - Describe how hand positions correlate to vtg's modes.
    - Introduce the three motion types shift and static.
    - Go through each of the motion type combinations individually.

 - Video 3 - Orientation:
    - Introduce the concept of orientation in relation to a center point.
    - Demonstrate unilateral vs bilateral with clubs and staffs.
    - Go through each of the orientation combinations individually.
    - Briefly indicate the existence of nonradial orientations.
